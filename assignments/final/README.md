I kind of want this game to be similar to an indie game– and one of my personal favorites– Stardew Valley when it comes to “townfolk” interactions. 

I plan for the player to start in a small “town” and the player can explore the houses for items that they would need to complete the game. 
The player will have something of an “inventory” (not sure how I will implement this yet– the inspiration design being the minecraft/stardew valley inventory 
where it shows the top like 10 items you have at the bottom of the screen but also maybe if you press a button it shows a bigger version of the inventory on 
a canvas —> horizontal layout group*) I’m thinking of a couple things: 1 being a “ladder” which the player can use to complete parkour tasks, another being a 
key that the player would need to enter the challenge area where they have to escape enemies which are kind of like a “final boss” and, similar to my units 
assignment, the enemy interaction will lead to having to completely restart the game. Another “item” the player can receive is a fairy or parrot– if the 
player has the fairy for the boss fight, they get a second chance if they interact with an enemy, “destroying” the fairy. The parrot will shoot pellets at 
nearby enemies to aid the player. I’m not sure how long I want it to be but I know I desire at least 2 areas. Also, when picking up an item a visual 
particle effect kind of like sparkling will come up, similar to that, when a player dies by the enemy, a particle effect of smoke or some “poof” will appear. 
I don’t think there will be any audio effects however I am considering cute sound effects for the town people similar to like animal crossing dialogue. 
I want one of the challenges [to obtain (an) item(s)] to be having to make a certain design like the conway’s life for example it could ask u to put in a 
design that would end up with 2 “planes” designs or something (design types and names will be taken/used from the wiki site). I want the end to be like the 
end of a mario game where the player jumps on a flag (or maybe something different just to be a little more original lol) and maybe do a little dance or something 
cute like that, with heart particle effects!

Low bar: my low bar is there will be AT LEAST 2 areas for the player to explore– this will include the enemy area as well as the town/townsfolk area. 

Target: I really want to get the fairy and parrot function down. It’s not necessary to the game but I think it would make it a lot more amusing and fun!

High bar: The high bar might sound silly but I want to make my movement really good. 
In my platformer game, the movement really sucked, and I really aim to make this one a lot better even though I’m not entirely sure yet how I would do that. 

### Timeline:

**December 1-3**: This time frame will focus entirely on the design of the levels, essentially the aesthetics of the game. 
This will include creating the different areas, the towns people, items, and any decorations (taken from poly pizza) that will make the level look nice.

**December 3-10:** This time frame will focus on the player code, townspeople code, enemy code, and items code. The reason why the time is so long is 
I aim to have the core mechanics of the code done by 12/6, however, this is accounting for debugs as well as ay additions made from class time suggestions. 
Player code will be prioritized, while smaller, less-important details visual and audio effects will likely not be implemented until after the 6th. 
These codes will also include any visual or audio effects. 

**10-11**: polishing! any details I think would make the game look better but also being realistic with the time frame. 

**DECEMBER 12**: daytime: write my “one pager” with game description and screenshots nighttime: SUBMIT!!!!!
